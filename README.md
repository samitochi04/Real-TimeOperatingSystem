# Real-TimeOperatingSystem
This Project Aim at Building a Minimal RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).

# Project Concept
Create a small Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) simulation in C.
This RTOS will emulate the behavior of an embedded system's task schulder, enabling you to run multiple tasks with priorities, timing, and basic resource management.

# How to get started?
1. Set Up Development Environment
- On Linux : 
    *Sudo apt update*
    *Sudo apt install build-essential gcc make gdb qemu*
gcc – For compiling C code.
make – To manage build processes.
gdb – For debugging.
qemu – If you want to emulate hardware later.
